Questions

Qualitative analysis
====================
Quality of the result can be measured by following checklist:
*  Is the password box easy to implement?
*  Does it spawn with a single line replacement, apart from library linking ?
*  Are the APIs working as described ?
*  Is graphic picker responding to all GPA boxes as per each one's approach ?

Quantitative analysis
=====================
*  Is it possible to spawn multiple GPA boxes per page ?
*  How long does the entire library take to load ? (Less is better)
*  What's the maximum length of password that this GPA box can handle ? (More
   is better)
